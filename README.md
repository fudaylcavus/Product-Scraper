# Product-Scraper
I created this demo project to learn and practice back-end systems. 

Project includes:
* Database Queries, 
* Headless Browsing,
* Scraping web elements, 
* Server-side rendering and HTML manipulation with EJS


## Used Technologies
* node.js
* express.js
* PostgreSQL
* EJS
* Puppeteer (It can be done with simple requests but wanted to learn headless browsing)


## What is it doing?

* It can give information about the `price`, `image url` and full `title` with given "Etsy (E-Commerce Website)" url.
* It saves every result, and then it makes able for you to **get list of pre-searched products**
* It can view single product with detailed information `/products/<id>`
